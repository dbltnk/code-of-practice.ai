# code-of-practice.ai

This is an inofficial, best-effort service to make the third draft of the EU AI Act [GPAI Code of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-code-practice) more accessible to all working group participants and observers. While I strive for accuracy, this is **not an official legal document**. Always refer to the official PDF document provided by the AI Office for the authoritative version. Any discrepancies between this site and the official document should be considered errors on my part. The canonical version of this project is hosted at [https://code-of-practice.ai/](https://code-of-practice.ai/).

## Contribution Guide

I'd be excited about your contributions. Here's how you can help:

1. **Report Issues**: Found a bug or have a suggestion? Open an issue here on GitHub.
2. **Submit Pull Requests**: Feel free to submit pull requests for any improvements, from fixed typos to new features. Please first discuss larger changes in an issue, or get in touch with me [via email](mailto:alexander.zacherl@googlemail.com).

I especially welcome contributions that make this site more accessible. I've tried to support screen readers and read up on the WAI guidelines, but am sure I have made lots of newbie mistakes in this area.

Note: This project was built quickly by an amateur, and all code was generated quickly. So while I welcome all contributions, and have already done one major refactor during development, be aware there is a lot of technical debt and some visual design debt. If you want to maintain a long-term version, strongly consider forking the repo and doing a full refactor before getting started.
